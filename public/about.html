<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am at a point in my life where I am actively trying to build myself, piece by piece. I am a college student balancing academics, skill-building, and responsibilities outside the classroom, while also learning how to manage my own expectations. I spend my days working on things that will shape my future—studying, practicing, planning—often pushing myself even when I feel behind or uncertain. Progress matters to me, even if it comes slowly.</p>

<p>I have taken on roles that ask more of me than comfort would allow, like stepping into leadership while still figuring myself out. Alongside this, I am working on concrete goals: improving my technical skills, strengthening my focus, and building a routine that keeps me grounded. There are interruptions, doubts, and days when momentum drops, but I don’t walk away. I pause, recalibrate, and return, because consistency has become more important to me than bursts of motivation.</p>

<p>Right now, my life is less about who I say I am and more about what I am doing—showing up, learning, and adapting. I am learning to accept where I stand without letting it define where I will end up. This phase is about effort, discipline, and growth, even when it feels quiet or unnoticed. I may not have everything figured out yet, but I am actively laying the foundation, and that work—steady and intentional—is what defines me most at this moment.</p>
